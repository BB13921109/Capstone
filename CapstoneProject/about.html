<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medi-Sight&rsquo;s primary aim is to redefine the way health researchers view data within their field. Through the creation of a data visualisation dashboard, the company wants to demonstrate how the use of a visual aid to represent data can assist medical practitioners during their exploratory efforts, and allow them to better extract salient information from even the most dense datasets. Translating the raw data into a visual form allows doctors (who often lack the expertise of big-data experts) to gain knowledge they would have otherwise missed.</span></p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medi-Sight focuses on data driven solutions for diabetes disease. Through the processing and visualising of this publicly available dataset, a data visualisation dashboard was created, containing a collection of visualisations to assist researchers in identifying the factors which impact the incidence of diabetes. Multiple hypotheses related to this objective were formulated and tested, with their results neatly displayed in the final product. The R program was used for this endeavour, with the dashboard intended to be viewable as an interactive website.</span></div>

<h2>The Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project is publicly available, and contains the precise medical information for 1000 patients who were tested for the presence of diabetes. There are 14 attributes present in the dataset, mostly pertaining to the contents of a particular bodily substance, which was deemed at least somewhat related to the incidence of diabetes. Each patient was classified as either diabetic, pre-diabetic, or non-diabetic.</p>
